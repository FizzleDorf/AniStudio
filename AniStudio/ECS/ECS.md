# Entity Component System (ECS)
This is the main design pattern for managing the render engines and game logic. This design pattern is not object oriented like other object component systems. Instead, this pattern is data oriented design that leverages components as structures of data, entities as a vectors of components and the systems run the processes depending on what components make up an entity. This makes the runtime experience dynamic by allowing the user to customize entities by adding, removing and/or replacing components to create unique implementations without having to code.
