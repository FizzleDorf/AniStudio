# Submodules
create submodule repositories here using:
```
git submodule add <github url> /Submodules/<submodule name>
```
*only add submodules over libraries if the repo/library is constantly being updated. this saves making constant commits replacing compiled libraries. If you wish to PR a new Submidule, please explain why in this mar*

### Current Submodules :

#### Dear IMGUI
Main GUI dependancy. New features are fairly regular as the repo is still maintained and very popular.

#### GGML
Main dependancy for machine learning inference. This repo is very active and a core dependancy for many ml projects. Major updates can happen at any time and needs regular pulls to keep current.
