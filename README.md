# Anistudio
An executable editor for image and video diffusion generation and editing projects written in C/C++ by utilizing [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) backend.

## Purpose
I created this application to leverage C/C++ for a highly modular and parallelized system capable of loading, inferencing, and training machine learning models, all within a unified UI. Existing UI solutions often rely on external tools for refining or editing, or suffer from performance issues due to JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python limitationsâ€”resulting in inconsistent rendering, slow loading, and cache misses. Most local open-source tools also require users to manage Python environments, adding complexity. AniStudio is designed to maintain consistent performance under heavy loads, allowing users to multitask traditional media creation with AI-assisted workflows, all in one seamless application.  

## Features
- Entity Component System for modular development with low technical debt
- Dockable Views to personalize your UI/UX experience
- Customizable ImGui Themes
- Image and video inference (StableDiffusion.cpp)
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux)
- Included UI editor for ease of development
